A4 - Another Attempt At Analysis
================================
Johannes Ebke <ebke@cern.ch>


Prerequisites
-------------

There are two main libraries which are required by A4:
 * Google Protocol Buffers (protobuf, http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/)
 * C++ Boost Library (http://www.boost.org/) version >= 1.41

Since you might not have these installed on your system, A4 provides scripts
that download them for you. They will then be compiled and installed
automatically together with A4 as 'builtin' libraries:

./get_protobuf.sh
./get_miniboost.sh


Installing from a Distribution
------------------------------

This part is for you if you are using a distribution package of A4.
You have probably downloaded and extracted a file named 'a4-0.X.tar.bz2' or
similar already.

To install A4 into 'my/software/a4' in your home directory, type:

./configure --prefix=$HOME/my/software/a4
make -j2 # you can replace 2 with your number of processors
make install

To add this installation to the PYTHONPATH, PATH and compiler flags, go to the
installation directory and run:

source bin/this_a4.sh

Now you can go into the tutorial/ directory in the A4 source distribution and
all the examples should work with the provided Makefiles - try it!

The generated executables (except for the python ones) should also work if you
have not sourced this_a4.sh.


Installing from a Git Checkout
------------------------------

If you checked out A4 from git, you first need to run

autoreconf -i

to generate the 'configure' script and install some auxiliary files.
To do this, you need the GNU Autotools, a very common software package.
The versions we tested were 2.59, 2.65 and 2.68, but please tell us
if your version does not work.


Troubleshooting
---------------

* In some cases autoreconf complains that it cannot find ltmain.sh.
Running "libtoolize" once fixed this.
