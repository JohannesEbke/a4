A4 Stream File Format
---------------------

An A4 stream file MUST be delimited by magic byte strings:
* start magic bytes: "A4STREAM"
* end magic bytes: "KTHXBYE4"

The rest of the file is a sequence of google protocol buffer messages. 
Each message is preceded by one or two 32-bit big-endian unsigned integers:

The first integer without the highest bit is the size of the message in bytes:
size = i1 & ((1<<31)-1)

If the highest bit of the first integer is set i1 (1<<31), 
then a second 32-bit integer with the CLASS_ID of the next message must follow.

At the end of the stream/file, an A4StreamFooter message is expected.
After an A4StreamFooter message, the size of that message is repeated as an
32-bit integer, to allow seeking backwards from the end of file.
