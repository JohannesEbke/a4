A4IO
----

The A4IO package provides A4 Streams - reading and writing

Concepts:
    * Event Stream: list of <Event> objects, with <MetaData> objects following after groups of events
    * Results: list of pairs (<Key>, <Result>), with <MetaData> following

 <Event> objects can have arbitrary format
 <Result> objects _must_ be addable (operator + / __add__, can be a logical merge)
 <MetaData> objects must be addable and can define a difference measure, which makes it
    possibe to merge metadata depending on different factors,
    e.g per lumiblock, per run or per stream


Streams of Events should be saved in .a4 files.
Results are saved in .results files (which are also a4 streams).

API:

class A4Reader:
    A4Reader(string filename)
    A4Reader(ptr<ZeroCopyInputStream>)

    read()

class A4Writer:
    A4Writer(string filename)
    A4Writer(ptr<ZeroCopyOutputStream>)
