A4Process
----

The A4Process package provides processing utilities.

Concepts:
    * Processing: Analyzing events and producing Results and/or another Stream of Events
      (Can be different Event class)

Streams of Events are saved in .a4 files.
Streams of Results are saved in .results files (which are also in the "a4" format).

Processing is done in executable files with the following syntax:

./my_analysis --config config_hww.ini --results my.results --output skim.a4 --input events.a4

To setup an analysis, one can use

a4_init_analysis

in an empty directory. An A4 Analysis project will be generated
